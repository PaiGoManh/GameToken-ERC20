Reward System for Gaming Platforms

**Use Case** : GameToken can be integrated into decentralized gaming platforms as a reward system or in-game currency.

**How It Works**:
Admin-Controlled Minting: The game developer (admin) can mint new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards.
In-Game Purchases: Players can spend GameTokens to buy virtual items like skins, weapons, or characters within the game.
Player-to-Player Trading: Players can trade GameTokens with each other for in-game assets.
Token Burning: Developers can burn GameTokens during special events or tournaments, introducing scarcity for exclusive in-game items.
